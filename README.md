# MarkovJuniorWeb
Typescript version of [MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior), runs on the web: https://yuu6883.github.io/MarkovJuniorWeb/
- Everything have been implemented including isometric rendering, exporting the output as a `.vox` file, and node tree visualization.
- **Every model from the original repository can be loaded with this project, but the output would be different due to different random seed implementation (dotnet builtin vs [seededrandom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seedrandom))**.
