# WIP
Most features have been implemented, include exporting the result as a `.vox` file.
However there is currently a mysterious bug that causes complex 3D models to fail:
- CarmaTower only generates a column
- ModernHouse only generates grass nodes
- SeaVilla only generates the base columns
- Apartemazements works fine!?? 😐

**Contribution would be appreciated** 🙏

## TODO
- Get rid of all the bugs
- Isometric renderer?
- Or just write a voxel renderer with webgpu
