# WIP
Most features have been implemented, including isometric rendering and exporting the result as a `.vox` file.
However there is currently a mysterious bug that causes complex 3D models to fail:
- CarmaTower only generates a column
- ModernHouse only generates grass nodes
- SeaVilla only generates the base columns
- Apartemazements works half of the time!?? 😐

**Contribution would be appreciated** 🙏
